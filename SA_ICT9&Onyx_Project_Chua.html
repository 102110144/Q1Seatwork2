If a grass fire starts nearby, these items next to your home could easily become kindling. Never dump hot ashes inside or near your home; keep them in a metal container well away from your house and garage.

<th><ul>
Excess electricity flowing through items in your home can always be a potential fire hazard. Things like computers, TVs, game systems and a whole lot more use electricity even when they’re not on. That means they can always experience a surge or they can just overheat and cause a fire. The continuous electricity that’s flowing into them provides them with a source for a fire as well. By unplugging these items when you’re not using them and, therefore, not paying attention to them, you can cut down on your chances of a fire.

<td><img src="https://undercovered777.github.io/project3rdqtr/unplugged2.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="center">Use Surge Protectors</td>
<th><ul>
At the very least, you want to make sure that all of your electronics are plugged into surge protectors. A surge in power is when you are most likely to experience an electrical fire and by plugging items into a surge protector you don’t have to worry about that excess electricity getting to the item and causing a fire. The surge protector keeps that extra out and can definitely reduce your risk of having a fire in the first place or the strength of it if you do get one.

<th><ul>
Flammable items like fabrics, paper, and even hair should always be kept away from excessive heat or flame. You want to keep your hair and your clothes out of the way when you’re starting a fire in your fireplace. You want to keep the stack of papers away from your wax melter. You also want to make sure that you’re watching closely for anything that could turn into a problem. You don’t want a fire to pop up anywhere and that means watching heat sources and anything close to them.
